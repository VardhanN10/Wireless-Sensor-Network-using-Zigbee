# 🔗 Wireless Sensor Network using Zigbee | EFR32MG12

This repository documents the creation of a **wireless sensor network** using **Zigbee protocol** on **EFR32MG12 boards** by Silicon Labs. The project demonstrates both **Centralized** and **Distributed architectures**, button-based interaction using On/Off commands, and **sensor data exchange through custom endpoints**.

📁 The project is modular, divided into 3 detailed sections:
- [1️⃣ Forming and Joining the Network](./forming-and-joining.md)
- [2️⃣ Sending On/Off Commands](./sending-onoff-commands.md)
- [3️⃣ Exchanging Sensor Data](./exchanging-sensor-data.md)

## 🧠 Project Summary

This project demonstrates:

- Forming and joining a Zigbee network using both **Coordinator-Router** (Centralized) and **Router-Router** (Distributed) architectures.
- Sending **On/Off commands** via hardware buttons on EFR32MG12 boards.
- Creating and using **custom endpoints** for **sensor data exchange** between Zigbee nodes.

It highlights network commissioning, device communication, and custom attribute design using the Silicon Labs Zigbee stack.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

The implementation is structured into three primary phases:

1. **Forming and Joining the Network**  
   → Configure one node as the **Coordinator (Light)** and the other as the **Router (Switch)**.  
   → Devices join the network, security keys are managed, and communication is established.

2. **Sending On/Off Commands**  
   → Use **physical buttons** to transmit **Zigbee On/Off commands** from the Router to the Coordinator.

3. **Exchanging Sensor Data**  
   → Design **custom endpoints** and **Zigbee attributes** for sensor data.  
   → Nodes share data dynamically over the Zigbee network.
